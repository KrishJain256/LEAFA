       "[Document(metadata={}, page_content='File_path: Papers/ESO201/Chem Thermo 1.pdf \\n## Summary:\\n\\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental concepts in chemical thermodynamics, focusing on predicting the spontaneity of chemical reactions and processes. It begins by introducing internal energy, its relationship to heat transfer, work, and matter exchange, and the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the energy of an isolated system remains constant. \\n\\nThe document explores pressure-volume work, relevant for gases, and the concept of reversible processes involving infinitesimal changes in pressure and volume. It then delves into heat capacity, the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a system, distinguishing between specific and molar heat capacities. \\n\\nThe document introduces entropy, a thermodynamic state function representing the randomness or disorder of a system, highlighting factors that affect it, such as randomness, heat absorption, temperature, volume, and molecular complexity. The third law of thermodynamics, stating that the entropy of a perfectly crystalline substance is zero at absolute zero, is also discussed. \\n\\nThe document explores spontaneity, the tendency of a process to occur naturally. It explains that spontaneity is governed by a decrease in energy (exothermic reactions) and an increase in entropy, with both factors needing to be considered simultaneously.\\n\\nThe document introduces Gibbs free energy (G = H - TS), where H is enthalpy, T is temperature, and S is entropy. It explains that Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) provides a direct measure of spontaneity: a negative ΔG indicates a spontaneous process, a positive ΔG indicates a non-spontaneous process, and a ΔG of zero signifies equilibrium.\\n\\nFinally, the document discusses the equilibrium constant (K_eq), a measure of the extent to which a reaction proceeds to completion at equilibrium. The document explains that the magnitude of ΔG° (standard Gibbs free energy change) determines the value of K_eq. A large K_eq indicates a reaction that favors product formation, while a small K_eq indicates a reaction that favors reactant formation. \\n\\n## Keywords:\\n\\nInternal Energy, Work, Heat Capacity, Entropy, Gibbs Free Energy, Spontaneity, Equilibrium Constant, First Law of Thermodynamics, Second Law of Thermodynamics, Third Law of Thermodynamics, Reversible Process, Irreversible Process, Exothermic, Endothermic, Enthalpy, Temperature, Pressure, Volume, Reaction Quotient, Standard Conditions, Standard Gibbs Free Energy of Formation, Phase Transition, Absolute Entropy. \\n'),\n",

It explores how these forms influence physical properties and processes, including phase transitions, dissolution, chemical reactions, and nuclear fission. \\n\\n**Intermolecular P.E.** plays a crucial role in phase changes, such as liquid to vapor, as well as in processes like dissolution, osmosis, and reverse osmosis. **Intramolecular P.E.** is significant during chemical reactions, including combustion and methane reforming. **Intra-atomic P.E.** is involved in nuclear fission.\\n\\nThe document further examines the properties of compressed liquids and provides an approximation method for calculating their enthalpy. It defines relative humidity and highlights its impact on thermal comfort and environmental processes, such as drying and precipitation.\\n\\n**Keywords:** Potential Energy, Intermolecular P.E., Intramolecular P.E., Intra-atomic P.E., Phase Changes, Dissolution, Osmosis, Reverse Osmosis, Chemical Reactions, Combustion, Reforming, Nuclear Fission, Compressed Liquids, Relative Humidity, Thermal Comfort, Precipitation. \\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"File_path: Papers/ESO201/Lecture 3.pdf \\nThis document provides a comprehensive explanation of internal energy, its relationship to the first law of thermodynamics, and its applications. It defines internal energy as the energy associated with the microscopic components of a system, excluding external forces. The state postulate is introduced, stating that two independent variables are sufficient to determine all other properties for a simple compressible system. Joule's experiments are highlighted, proving the equivalence of different energy forms in changing internal energy and establishing it as a state function.\\n\\nThe first law of thermodynamics is introduced, initially for adiabatic processes, where work done on the system equals the change in internal energy. This law is then generalized to encompass heat transfer and changes in kinetic and potential energy. The document explains heat transfer and its relationship to internal energy changes, emphasizing that both heat transfer and work are path-dependent.\\n\\nThe document further explores the calculation of work due to volume changes, particularly for slow expansion processes. Two illustrative examples demonstrate applying the first law of thermodynamics: an object falling through a height and the acceleration of air by a fan. These examples showcase the universality of the first law, regardless of system definition or external forces.\\n\\n**Keywords:** Internal energy, state postulate, Joule's experiments, adiabatic process, first law of thermodynamics, heat transfer, work, state function, path-dependent, volume change, kinetic energy, potential energy, control mass, system, equilibrium states. \\n\"),\n",
