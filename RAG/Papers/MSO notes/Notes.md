The remark you're referring to is about a **computational method** developed using a formula denoted as (*), which allows one to compute the values of a function and its derivatives at any point inside a closed curve using the values of the function along the boundary of the curve. This concept comes from **complex analysis**, specifically from **Cauchy's integral formula** and its generalizations. Let's break this down in detail:

### 1. **The Formula (*) and Cauchy's Integral Theorem**:

The formula (*) being referenced is likely a version of **Cauchy's Integral Formula**, which states that for a holomorphic (complex differentiable) function \( f(z) \) inside a simple, closed, and piecewise smooth curve \( \Gamma \), the value of the function at any point \( a \) inside \( \Gamma \) can be calculated using the integral of the function around \( \Gamma \):

$$ f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\Gamma} \frac{f(z)}{z - a} \, dz $$

This formula shows that if we know the values of \( f(z) \) on the boundary \( \Gamma \), we can compute the value of \( f \) at any point \( a \) inside the curve. 

The formula can also be extended to compute the **derivatives** of the function:

$$
f^{(n)}(a) = \frac{n!}{2\pi i} \int_{\Gamma} \frac{f(z)}{(z - a)^{n+1}} \, dz
$$

This means that not only the value of the function but also all its derivatives at \( a \) can be computed using the values of the function on \( \Gamma \).

### 2. **Key Benefits of This Formula**:

- **Accessible vs. Inaccessible Points**:
  The key idea is that sometimes we may not be able to directly compute the function or its derivatives at certain points (which are termed "inaccessible" points). For example, if it's difficult to evaluate the function at a specific point due to some practical limitation, but we can compute or measure the function on a surrounding boundary (the curve \( \Gamma \)), then using Cauchy's Integral Formula, we can compute the value at the inaccessible point from the boundary values.

- **Values at Boundary Points**:
  The function is assumed to be known along the boundary curve \( \Gamma \) (these are the "accessible" points). The formula lets us extend that information to find the function and its derivatives at points inside the boundary.

### 3. **Complex Variable Boundary Element Method (CVBEM)**:

The **Complex Variable Boundary Element Method (CVBEM)** is a **numerical method** used in computational mathematics and engineering, particularly for solving boundary value problems in domains where the governing equation is Laplace's equation or other related elliptic partial differential equations. CVBEM leverages the formula (*) (like Cauchy's integral formula) to computationally calculate function values and their derivatives.

- **Key Idea**:
  The core idea of CVBEM is to use the **boundary conditions** (the known values of the function on the boundary of a domain) to generate values of the function and its derivatives at any point within the domain. This is highly useful in physics, engineering, and applied mathematics, where solving boundary value problems is crucial, such as in **fluid dynamics**, **electromagnetism**, or **heat transfer**.

- **Advantages of CVBEM**:
  1. **Reduces dimensionality**: It turns a 2D problem into a 1D boundary integral problem (reducing the complexity of the problem).
  2. **Computational efficiency**: The method focuses on boundary data, which often means fewer computational resources are needed compared to solving the problem over the entire domain.
  3. **Accurate results**: Since Cauchyâ€™s integral formula is exact for holomorphic functions, the method can provide very accurate solutions for certain classes of problems.

### 4. **Application Example**:

Let's say you want to solve a problem in heat conduction (a type of boundary value problem) where you know the temperature distribution along the boundary of a region but need to find the temperature at internal points. Using the CVBEM, you can calculate the internal temperature and even its rate of change (derivatives) from the boundary temperature distribution.

### 5. **Summary of the Process**:

1. Define a boundary \( \Gamma \) around the region where the function (or solution) is known.
2. Use the boundary values of the function \( f(z) \) and the appropriate form of the integral formula (*) (such as Cauchy's integral formula) to calculate the function and its derivatives inside the region.
3. This method helps compute values at points that are otherwise difficult to evaluate directly, all through known boundary data.

### Conclusion:

The formula (*) referred to in your remark is a form of Cauchy's Integral Formula, which is powerful in complex analysis for finding function values inside a region based on boundary data. The **Complex Variable Boundary Element Method** (CVBEM) uses this idea computationally to solve practical problems by leveraging values of the function at accessible boundary points to deduce values at inaccessible interior points. This is particularly useful for problems in fields like engineering and physics that involve boundary value problems.
